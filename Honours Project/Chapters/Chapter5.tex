\section{The package}
With the help of the {\bf devtools} package \citep{devtoolspackage} for package building, the {\bf roxygen2}  package \citep{roxygen2package} for package documentation amd the {\bf formatR} \citep{formatrpackage} package for formatting. The full {\bf svydb} package has been uploaded and can be found on \href{https://github.com/chrk623/svydb}{Github}, where it also includes basic help pages for each functions that computes survey statistics.\\

The dependant packages of {\bf svydb} are,
{\bf
    \begin{itemize}
        \item R6 \citep{R6package}
        \item dplyr \citep{dplyrpackage}
        \item rlang \citep{rlangpackage}
        \item survey \citep{surveypackage}
        \item ggplot2 \citep{ggplotpackage}
    \end{itemize}
}



\section{Supporting functions}
Along with the main functions which computes survey statistics, there are also a number of other functions that were written to help with the implementation of the main functions, testing those functions and to overcome difficulties where there are inconsistency in terms of how to query between different types of databases. Details of these functions can be found in Appendix \ref{appena:otherfunc}.

\section{Testing}


Examples within the {\bf survey} package help page was used to test {\bf svydb}, all results were identical, except for when the data sets are large enough that it causes rounding error. When examples were not available for certain functions, alternatives were used.
