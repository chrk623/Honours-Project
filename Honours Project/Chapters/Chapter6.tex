\chapter{Discussion} \label{c6}

\section{Overview}
The objective of this project is to build a tool in {\sf R} to compute survey statistics for large data sets which cannot be fit into memory and investigate whether it is feasible to do so.\\

From the results in chapter \ref{c4} we can see that overall, computing survey statistics in a database is definitely feasible for certain types of statistics, that is statistics that does not require many iterations. It is also possible that other statistics that does not heavily depend on statistical or mathematical operations can be computed in a database efficiently.

Additionally, we have found that {\bf dplyr} and {\bf dbplyr} seems to be implemented in a very efficient manner.


\section{Future work}
\subsection{Error Messages}
More user friendly error messages should be added. Currently while computing statistics with {\bf svydb}, when there is an error in the code, it will only show where the error is without any explanations.

\subsection{Functions}
%The kernel density smoother was written but it contains many bugs and is very slow, this should be completed in a %efficient manner. 
In general, more functions should be built into {\bf svydb}.
